# BookTitleMovieCandidate
Is a book going to make a good movie script candidate or not?

as a starting point, I'll work with data from the Seattle Public Library Database here:

https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6


Based on just how often a certain book gets checked out, how likely is it that it would make a good movie?
